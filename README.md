This project is for the Udacity Front End NanoDegree Program. Requirements are described at this link: (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view)

## What is the Arcade Game
The arcade game is a classic remake of "frogger" in which the player controls a character and navigates them across the street while dodging enemies (bugs) and gathering tokens (gems, keys, hearts) for extra points and lives. The enemy objects cross the road at different paces making it more and more difficult to cross each level. Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, the player must be swift to make it across.

## Challenge
Make it across the street and gather as many tokens as possible, racking up points and surviving numerous rounds

## How to Play
* The game can be played here - https://bobbypapson.github.io/
* If you want to run the game locally, you can clone or download the project files and run the "index.html" file
* The game automatically begins once the page loads and the enemy bugs start crawling across the screen at different paces. The player can use the arrow buttons on their keyboard in order to navigate forward, backwards, and side to side. The player needs to make it all the way across the street without colliding with enemy bugs to earn points and move forward to the next level. Collecting gems, keys, and hearts also gives the player bonus points as well as lives!
